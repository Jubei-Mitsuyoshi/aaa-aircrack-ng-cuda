=== Requirements ===

 * OpenSSL development package
 * If you want to use airolib-ng and '-r' option on aircrack-ng, 
   - SQLite development package >= 3.3.17 (3.6.X version or better is recommended)
   - autoconf 2.50
   - libtool
 * On windows, cygwin has to be use and it also requires w32api and gcc-4 package.
 * If you want to use Airpcap, the 'developer' directory from the CD is required.
 * On OSX, patch is required.

=== Compilating ===

 * Compilation:
    make

 * Strip debugging symbols:
    make strip

 * Installing:
    make install

 * Uninstall:
    make uninstall

Note: On OSX (Intel), Aircrack-ng must be patched before compiling:

      cd aircrack-ng-1.0rc3/src
      patch -i ../patches/aicrack-ng-rc2_Intel_macOSX.patch

==== Makefile flags ====

When compile and installing, the following flags can be used and combined
to compile and install the suite:

* sqlite:   needed to compile airolib-ng and add support for airolib-ng
            databases in aircrack-ng.
            On cygwin: SQLite has to be compiled manually. See next section.

* airpcap:  needed for supporting airpcap devices on windows (cygwin only)
            REQUIREMENT: Copy 'developers' directory from Airpcap CD one 
                         level below this INSTALLING file
            Note: Not working yet.

* unstable: needed to compile tkiptun-ng, easside-ng (and buddy-ng) and
            wesside-ng

Example:

  * Compiling:
    make sqlite=true unstable=true

  * Installing:
    make sqlite=true unstable=true install

=== Compiling sqlite on cygwin ===

  wget http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-3.6.14.tar.gz
  tar -zxf sqlite-3.6.14.tar.gz
  cd sqlite-3.6.14
  autoconf
  ./configure --disable-tcl
  
  wget http://patches.aircrack-ng.org/sqlite-3.6.13-lib_cygwin.diff
  patch -i sqlite-3.6.13-lib_cygwin.diff
  
  make
  make install

=== Using precompiled binaries ===

Linux/BSD:
 * Use your package manager to download aircrack-ng
 * In most cases, they have an old version.
 
Windows:
 * Install the appropriate "monitor" driver for your card (standard drivers doesn't work for capturing data)
   See "Drivers" page on the wiki: http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=drivers and 
 * aircrack-ng suite is command line tools. So, you have to open a commandline
   (Start menu -> Run... -> cmd.exe) then use them
 * Run the executables without any parameters to have help
