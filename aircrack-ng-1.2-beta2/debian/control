Description: An 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK key cracking program
 Aircrack-ng is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking 
 program that can recover keys once enough data packets 
 have been captured. It implements the standard FMS attack 
 along with some optimizations like KoreK attacks, as well 
 as the all-new PTW attack, thus making the attack much 
 faster compared to other WEP cracking tools.
